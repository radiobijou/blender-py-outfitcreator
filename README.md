### Overview 

Using this tool, you can preview and pick your favourite combinations of three-part outfits inside Blender. Afterwards, a model will be exported in the format of your choice.

### Naming the outfit

To name your outfit, write your desired text in the first input cell.

### Picking the combination

In the drop-down menus named **Top Style**, **Bottom Style** and **Footwear Style**, you can find all the possible outfit pieces, named by style. 
The **Compose Outfit** button will preview your choice in the viewport.

### Randomizing

You can generate a random outift using the **Generate Random** button. 

### Export format

Once happy with the combination, you can pick an export format and press the **Export Outfit button**. This action will create a 3D file in the directory where your .blend file is located. This file contains the three clothing pieces, as well as a full body mesh and rig. What is specified in the textbox, will be used as a name for the file.

### Batch Generation and Export
Another way to use this tool would be clicking the **Batch Generate and Export** button which would create 10 different randomly generated combinations and export them in the .blend file location.
